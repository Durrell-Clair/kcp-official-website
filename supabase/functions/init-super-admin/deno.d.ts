// Type declarations for Deno runtime in Supabase Edge Functions
// This file is used to suppress TypeScript errors for Deno-specific APIs
// The actual types are provided by the Deno runtime at execution time

// Note: We use @ts-ignore comments in the source files instead of declaring
// these types here to avoid conflicts with existing type definitions
